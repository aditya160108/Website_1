# Website_1
Creating a flask website based on HTML and Python.
This code creates a Flask web application with two routes. 
The homepage route renders the "index.html" template with the variable content, and the "/test" route renders the "new.html" template. 
When the application is run, it starts a development server for testing and debugging purposes.
